# hunter-minigame
A Minecraft minigame for 1.16.

This is a Minecraft minigame that is an idea based on the popular detective type game Among Us. There are two roles, the survivors and the hunter. 

The hunter has the task of killing all survivors before being discovered and killed themselves.

The survivors have to find clues with parts of the name(display name) of the killer and group up and kill them. However, they don't have weapons(unless they find one), whereas the killer has a set of armor(unequipped) and a sword.
